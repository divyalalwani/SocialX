This is a blockchain social network powered by smart contracts where you can get paid to post.
Other users can tip your status updates with cryptocurrency, so that youâ€™re rewarded for creating great content.
It's censorship resistant, so nobody can restrict the content that you post or see.
I have even curated the news feed so that the most tipped posts appear at the top, instead of relying upon "an algorithm" that nobody understands.
It also has a slick mobile-friendly user interface, where everyone gets a fancy icon automatically for their account.

Here is a complete list of all the files inside the project:

Truffle Project Structure

migrations directory: this is where the migration files will live that allow us to put new smart contracts on the blockchain.

node_modules directory: this is where all of our dependencies get installed for the project.

public directory: this where we'll store the images for the project.

src directory: this is the main folder for our client-side website, and our smart contract source code.

./src/components directory: this is where we will develop all of the React.js components that power our client side website.

./src/contracts directory: this is the folder where we will develop the source code for our smart contracts with Solidity
